# 📄 $ACADEMY Token & Ecosystem Whitepaper

## 1. Vision
Superteam Academy aims to be the primary educational layer for the Solana ecosystem. By aligning incentives between learners and protocols, we create a sustainable "Learn-to-Earn" flywheel.

## 2. The $ACADEMY Token
$ACADEMY is a utility and governance token (built on Token-2022) that powers the reputation system of the platform.

### Token Utility
- **Gated Tracks**: High-tier courses (e.g., Cross-Program Invocations, Security Audits) require staking $ACADEMY to unlock.
- **Learn-to-Earn Rewards**: Students earn small amounts of $ACADEMY upon successfully minting course cNFTs.
- **Protocol Sponsorships**: Protocols (like Jupiter or Helius) can deposit $ACADEMY to sponsor specific tracks and attract developers.

## 3. On-Chain Reputation (Non-Transferable XP)
While $ACADEMY is liquid, **Player XP** is a Soulbound Token (Token-2022 Non-Transferable). 
- Your level and achievements are non-buyable. 
- They represent true technical capability, verified on-chain.

## 4. Credentialing via cNFTs (Bubblegum)
All certificates are issued as Compressed NFTs.
- **Low Cost**: Issuing 1,000,000 certificates costs ~5 SOL, compared to ~12,000 SOL for standard NFTs.
- **Metadata Composability**: Other protocols can query the DAS API to verify if a wallet is qualified for a specific developer task or grant based on their Academy credentials.

## 5. Roadmap
- **Q1 2026**: Interactive Coding Challenges with Monaco Editor (DONE).
- **Q2 2026**: Mainnet launch of $ACADEMY Token and Staking.
- **Q3 2026**: Integration with Superteam Earn for automatic bounty qualification.
- **Q4 2026**: DAO Governance for curriculum updates.
